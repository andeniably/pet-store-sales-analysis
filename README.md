# 🐾 Pet Store Sales Analysis — Data Analytics Portfolio Project

This is a portfolio project created as part of my Python Data Analytics training. It explores transactional sales data from a fictional pet store using the OSEMN data science framework. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my end-to-end data analytics capabilities—data cleaning, exploration, interpretation, and visualization—using real Python code.
